In SVD the rank is the number of non zero singular values

M = U * Sigma * V(^T)

Can get M in three steps: decompose the matrix using V star, Sigma to apply scaling in different directions (m x n wiht pivot values), and then transformation U (m x m). 
NB: V* is same as V transpose


SVD is very expensive to do, so not done that much.


Closest point:
if you're in a minimum the difference between x* and xk+1 is 0 as the closest point on a straight line to x* is orthogonal (perpendicular to x*).
