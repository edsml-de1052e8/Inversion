# Lecture 5: Gradient Based optimisation 

Optimisation: quadratic best viewed as contour plot. 
Reminder that obviously these are just approximations. 

-> contour plot with bubble around initial guess x0, the solution will be outside of it towards x1. 
Gradient is orthogonal to boundary of the circle ‚≠ïÔ∏è. 

That is another way of saying that the gradient has no component in the other direction on the right (horizontal) basically. Because otherwise that would mean that the function is still increasing.
Gradient has to be in the same direction, that is to say they are scalars : mu f'(x) 
NB: the larger you make mu the closer and closer you will get from x1 to x0. 

As a result you get the matrix formed of sum of two parts, by adding the Hassian, and the identity matrix I on the left.
